# **Frequently Asked Questions**

_Updating as questions arise but for now this get's the hard questions out of
the way_

### **How does this work?**

Cephalon Navis uses WFCD API to access a publicly accessible profile endpoint,
which is used to request read-only data. In short this is data that you as a
user can request from DE at any point.

### **Will this get my account banned?**

The short answer, no. The long answer is
[Warframe Third-Party software and you](https://support.warframe.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030014351-Third-Party-Software-and-You).

### **I play on console, how do I get my account ID?**

1. Login to [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/)
2. Press F12 (or how ever you open developer tools for your browser)
3. Access your cookies
   - Firefox: Storage -> Cookies
   - Chrome: Application -> Cookie
4. Click `https://www.warframe.com/`
5. On the right hand side look for the value `gid`
6. Copy and paste the value [here](/)
7. Now you're ready to scan the QR code with Cephalon Navis and get started
   tracking your Arsenal

### **Does this count as a login instance**

Nope not all, since you're not logging in.

### **If this doesn't count as a log in, why do I need to log into warframe.com to get my account ID?**

For console players this is the only way to get your account ID in order to pull
your data. No worries though, this still does not give Cephalon Navis write
access to your account

_For PC players simply use your `EE.log` in the root of
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Warframe`_

### **What happens if DE removes/restricts access to this profile endpoint?**

The arsenal feature will be temporarily disabled and reworked to be of a manual
process

### **Hey, I represent DE and I have some questions. Where can I contact you?**

Oh sweet sol... you can email [here](mailto:devs@warframestat.us)
