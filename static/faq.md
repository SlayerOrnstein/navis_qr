# **Frequently Asked Questions**

_Updating as questions arise but for now this get's the hard questions out of
the way_

### **How does this work?**

Cephalon Navis uses WFCD API to access a publicly accessible profile endpoint,
which is used to request read-only data. In short this is data that you as a
user can request from DE at any point.

### **Will this get my account banned?**

The short answer, no. The long answer is
[Warframe Third-Party software and you](https://suport.warframe.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030014351-Third-Party-Software-and-You).

### **Does this count as a login instance**

Nope not all, since you're not logging in at all.

### **If this doesn't count as logging in, why do I need to log into warframe.com to get my account ID?**

For console players this is the only way to get your account ID in order to pull
your data. No worries though, this still does not give Cephalon Navis write
access to your account

### **What happens if DE removes/restricts access to this GDPR endpoint?**

The arsenal feature will be temporarily disabled and reworked to be a more
manual process

### **Hey, I represent DE and I have some questions. Where can I contact you?**
